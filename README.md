echo "# Sign Language Word-Level Translator

This is a desktop-based real-time American Sign Language (ASL) word-level translator. It uses **MediaPipe** for hand gesture detection, **LSTM** for sequence modeling, and **OpenCV** for webcam input. The model recognizes basic ASL words like **\"hello\"**, **\"thanks\"**, **\"yes\"**, and **\"no\"**.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-level-translator.git
cd word-level-translator
\`\`\`

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

\`\`\`bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
\`\`\`

### 3. Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

---

##  Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Collect Data

Record gesture frames using:
\`\`\`bash
python record.py
\`\`\`
This will save frames into the format:
\`\`\`
data/<word>/<sequence>/<frame>.jpg
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Process Data

Extract keypoints from the collected images:
\`\`\`bash
python process.py
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Train the Model

Train the LSTM-based gesture recognition model:
\`\`\`bash
python train.py
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Run Real-Time Prediction

Use your webcam for live gesture translation:
\`\`\`bash
python predict.py
\`\`\`

---
If you have already recorded the gesture data and nothing new has been added, you can skip the processing and training steps — just run the prediction script.

However, if you record new gesture data or modify the existing dataset, make sure to run the processing and training scripts again before predicting. This ensures the model includes the updated data.

---
##  Notes

- Ensure your **webcam is working**.
- Dependencies must be installed from \`requirements.txt\`.
- Training and prediction scripts assume data is in \`data/\` and processed output is stored in \`MP_Data/\` (you can modify paths as needed).
